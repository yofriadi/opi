## Field Semantics

| Field | Type | Mutability | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | int | reinit-only | Current value `2`. v2 adds `task_owned_paths`, `definition_source`, `replaces`, `baseline_dirty_files`, `spec_files`, `spec_files_sha256`, `phase_exit[N].snapshot_path`, `phase_exit[N].task_summary`, dotted sub-task IDs, and open-string `crate` values. Reading a v1 ledger requires explicit reinit-time migration; refuse unknown versions. |
| `spec_files` | array | const-on-init, reinit-editable | Normative spec file paths whose drift triggers reinit refusal. Default `["docs/opi-spec.md"]`. Supplemental phases MUST include only the reviewed source files registered in `skill.md` for the active phase, plus `docs/opi-spec.md`. Adding or removing a path requires `--reinit`. |
| `spec_files_sha256` | object | reinit-only | Map of file path → SHA-256 hash at last init/reinit. Each entry is checked independently; any mismatch triggers the spec-alignment guard. |
| `task_graph_confirmed_at` | string/null | init/reinit | ISO-8601 confirmation time |
| `current_phase` | int | auto | Lowest phase with non-`passing` task |
| `tasks[].id` | string | const | Matches a row in `opi-spec.md` §15 OR a sub-task expansion. Pattern: `^\d+\.\d+(\.\d+)?$`. Sub-task IDs carry a third component (e.g. `4.6.1`) and MUST also set `parent_spec_row`. |
| `tasks[].phase` | int | const | From row's phase grouping |
| `tasks[].title` | string | const | Spec row title |
| `tasks[].crate` | string | const | One of opi's five crates, `workspace`, or any free-string identifier (e.g. `examples`, `package-template`) when the spec row uses an open identifier. Review-gate warns for unknown values but does not refuse. |
| `tasks[].parent_spec_row` | string/null | const | Source spec row ID when this task is a sub-task expansion (e.g. `"4.7"` for `4.7.1`). Direct spec rows MUST use `null`, not an empty string. |
| `tasks[].definition_of_done` | string | const | Verbatim from spec |
| `tasks[].definition_source` | enum | const | `verbatim`, `inferred`, or `draft-reviewed`; inferred values require review gate confirmation |
| `tasks[].replaces` | string/null | const | Prior task title/meaning superseded during reinit, when the same task ID was repurposed by spec changes |
| `tasks[].status` | enum | runtime | `failing`/`in_progress`/`passing`/`blocked`/`archived` |
| `tasks[].depends_on` | array | const | Task IDs that must be `passing` |
| `tasks[].inference_notes` | array | const | Reasons for inferred fields. Phase non-goal guards are recorded with `field = "forbidden_scope"` and an exact source heading. |
| `tasks[].tier` | enum | const | `documentation`/`workspace`/`library`/`cli-tool`/`cli-runtime`/`tui` |
| `tasks[].commit_type` | enum | const | `feat`/`fix`/`docs`/`refactor`/`test`/`chore`/`perf` |
| `tasks[].parallelize` | array | const | Sub-unit names for parallel dispatch |
| `tasks[].evaluator_required` | bool | const | Static risk flag |
| `tasks[].verification` | object | const | Tier-specific gate spec |
| `tasks[].acceptance_scenarios` | array | const-on-init, reinit-editable | Product/user-path scenarios owned by this task. Required when the task closes a source-spec goal, success criterion, exit criterion, or workflow. Each scenario has `id`, `source`, `scenario`, `verification`, `production_call_sites`, and runtime `status` (`open`, `met`, or `deferred-by-updated-design`). Component/substrate tasks may use `[]`, but then they cannot close a product acceptance criterion. |
| `tasks[].production_call_sites` | array | const-on-init, append-only during Phase C | Production entry points that must call or exercise this task's implementation before the task can close runtime acceptance. Examples: CLI subcommand handler, harness startup, agent loop hook wrapper, session persistence path. Tests-only helpers do not count. |
| `tasks[].substrate_only` | bool | const-on-init, reinit-editable | `true` means the task intentionally implements a helper/parser/protocol/bridge slice and cannot by itself close product acceptance scenarios. A later vertical-slice task must consume it through a production call site. |
| `tasks[].iteration_count` | int | runtime | Attempts since `in_progress` |
| `tasks[].max_iterations` | int | const | Default 5 |
| `tasks[].start_commit` | string/null | runtime | HEAD when Phase B confirms |
| `tasks[].baseline_dirty_files` | array | runtime | Files already dirty at Phase B start; used to avoid cleaning or staging unrelated user work |
| `tasks[].task_owned_paths` | array | const-at-Phase-B, append-only during Phase C | Glob patterns the task is allowed to modify. Default derived from `crate` at init/reinit time (e.g. `crate = "opi-agent"` → `["crates/opi-agent/**", "Cargo.toml"]`). Phase C MAY append entries when implementation requires touching outside-prefix files; each append MUST add an `inference_notes` entry with `field = "task_owned_paths"` and a `reason`, written via the atomic ledger write. |
| `tasks[].last_attempt` | object/null | runtime | `{attempt, started_at, ended_at, outcome, failing_gate, touched_files}` |
| `tasks[].verified_at_commit` | string | runtime | Set in Phase E.2 |
| `tasks[].evidence` | object/null | runtime | Mirror of `Opi-*` commit footers |
| `tasks[].blocker` | string | runtime | Populated when `status = blocked` |
| `tasks[].session_notes` | array | runtime | Append-only `{timestamp, attempt, summary, gate_results}` |
| `phase_exit[N]` | object | runtime | `completed_at` + `exit_criteria_met` + evaluator summary |
| `phase_exit[N].snapshot_path` | string/null | runtime | Path to a committed phase-local snapshot at the moment phase `N` exited. `null` while the phase is incomplete. Written under `docs/snapshots/phase<N>/`. |
| `phase_exit[N].criteria_trace` | array | runtime/archive | Phase-exit evaluator's independent trace from current source-spec success/exit criteria to evidence. Every item uses `status = met`, `deferred-by-updated-design`, or `not-met`. Phase archive is refused if any item is `not-met` or if a deferral lacks an exact current-spec citation. Keep detailed traces in the phase-local snapshot or sibling audit markdown; root ledger entries should omit or summarize them to avoid growth. |
| `phase_exit[N].task_summary` | array | runtime | `[{id, title, status, verified_at_commit}]` for every task that belonged to phase `N` at exit time. Lets `--status` report completed phases without reading the snapshot file. |

Archive snapshots are intentionally phase-local: they include top-level
schema/spec metadata, the archived phase's completed `tasks`, and only that
phase's `phase_exit[N]` record. Do not copy older `phase_exit` records into new
snapshots. The root ledger remains the compact index for dependency checks and
status reporting through `phase_exit[*].task_summary`; it should hold short
exit metadata, `snapshot_path`, and `task_summary`, not expanded evidence
tables.

Validation rule: every path listed in `tasks[].verification.behavioral_tests` MUST be matched by at least one `task_owned_paths` glob before the task graph is confirmed. This prevents Phase C from needing an immediate ownership expansion just to create the task's declared tests.

Validation rule: when `behavioral_tests` references more than one crate, either `tier` MUST be `workspace` or `verification.library_gates` MUST include mechanical gates for every referenced crate. Snapshot-bearing tests also require `snapshot_tests` and explicit snapshot approval under the `tui` rules.

Validation rule: `task_owned_paths` MUST NOT include broad documentation globs
such as `docs/**` when a narrower subtree can satisfy the task. Use a
purpose-specific path such as `docs/extension-examples/**` for example
packages. `docs/opi-spec.md` is normative input and MUST NOT be task-owned
unless the task is a reviewed documentation/alignment task whose DoD explicitly
requires updating `docs/opi-spec.md` and its localized counterpart.

Validation rule: every source-spec success criterion, exit criterion, goal, or
named user workflow for the active phase MUST be represented by at least one
`acceptance_scenarios` entry before the task graph is confirmed. If the
criterion is intentionally deferred, the scenario must be assigned to a
documentation/alignment task that updates the source spec or records an exact
current-spec citation for the deferral.

Validation rule: for phases 5-14, `spec_files` MUST include the registered
supplemental source file(s) for the active phase as listed in `skill.md`.
Unregistered design docs, snapshot files, skill source files, `AGENTS.md`, and
`CLAUDE.md` MUST NOT be added to `spec_files`.

Validation rule: every Non-Goal in the registered active phase source MUST be
represented either by a `forbidden_scope` inference note on the relevant task
family or by a phase-specific verification addendum. A task that implements a
phase non-goal cannot be marked passing unless the source spec was updated and
the ledger was reconciled through `--reinit`.

Validation rule: a task with non-empty `acceptance_scenarios` MUST include at
least one behavioral, subprocess, harness, or integration verification command
for each scenario. Pure parser/helper/unit tests may supplement but cannot be
the only evidence for a user-facing runtime workflow.

Validation rule: a runtime, startup, CLI, session, adapter, provider, or
extension claim MUST list `production_call_sites`. If the implementation has no
production call site yet, set `substrate_only = true`, keep acceptance scenarios
open, and create or retain a later vertical-slice task.

## Durable Evidence Contract

The ledger is mutable runtime state (gitignored). Every successful task commit
MUST include parseable footers:

```text
Opi-Task: <id>
Opi-DoD-SHA256: <sha256 of definition_of_done>
Opi-Verification: <tier>; <short command/result summary>
Opi-Evaluator: <not-required | passed>
```

These values are also copied into `tasks[].evidence`. A fresh clone without the
ledger can reconstruct completion status via `git log --grep "Opi-Task:"`.

Tasks with non-empty `acceptance_scenarios` also include:

```text
Opi-Acceptance: <scenario ids>; <command/test/call-site evidence summary>
```

## Atomic Write Protocol

1. Serialize full JSON with a structured writer (not shell echo/string concat).
2. Write to `.opi-impl-state.json.tmp` in repo root.
3. Flush file; fsync parent directory when platform exposes it.
4. Rename `.opi-impl-state.json.tmp` over `.opi-impl-state.json`.
5. On failure, leave previous ledger intact; print tmp path for inspection.

**Write boundaries** (the only times the ledger is written):
- End of Phase B (user confirms): mark `in_progress`, record `start_commit`
- Each attempt boundary: record start, failing gate, touched files
- Failure decision gate: mark `blocked`, extend cap, or record handoff
- End of Phase E: mark `passing`, record commit + evidence
- Reinit after task-graph review gate confirmed

## v1 → v2 Migration

Reinit MUST run this migration before any reconciliation when it loads a
ledger with `schema_version < 2`. The migration is applied to a draft copy;
nothing is overwritten until the task-graph review gate confirms.

Per-task rules:

- `definition_source`: compute by re-parsing the spec roadmap row.
  - Spec row has explicit DoD column AND the v1 DoD string matches → `"verbatim"`.
  - Spec row has no DoD column AND the v1 DoD's SHA-256 matches the
    `Opi-DoD-SHA256` footer of the task's `verified_at_commit` → `"draft-reviewed"`
    (work shipped under that DoD; preserve).
  - Anything else → `"inferred"` AND demote `status` to `failing` AND require
    re-confirmation at the task-graph review gate.
- `replaces`: when the same task ID exists in v1 ledger and current spec but
  title or DoD changed substantively (string distance beyond trivial whitespace
  or punctuation), fill with the v1 title. Else `null`.
- `baseline_dirty_files`: always `[]` at migration time; populated fresh at the
  next Phase B.
- `task_owned_paths`: derive from `tasks[].crate` per the rules in the field
  definition (e.g. `crate = "opi-agent"` → `["crates/opi-agent/**", "Cargo.toml"]`).
- `acceptance_scenarios`: set to `[]` for legacy tasks, then require reinit
  task-graph review to populate scenarios for any current source-spec criteria
  the task claims to close.
- `production_call_sites`: set to `[]` for legacy tasks; task-graph review must
  populate it before runtime/startup/CLI/session/adapter/provider claims can be
  executable.
- `substrate_only`: set to `false` by default; review may set `true` for
  helper/parser/protocol/bridge tasks that intentionally do not close a product
  acceptance scenario.

Top-level field rules:

- `spec_sha256` (v1 string) → `spec_files` = `["docs/opi-spec.md"]` AND
  `spec_files_sha256` = `{"docs/opi-spec.md": <existing-hash>}`. Delete the
  v1 `spec_sha256` key.
- `phase{N}_summary` (v1 informal top-level array) → `phase_exit["<N>"].task_summary`.
  Delete the v1 top-level keys.
- `phase{N}_snapshot` (v1 informal top-level string) → `phase_exit["<N>"].snapshot_path`.
  Delete the v1 top-level keys.

After successful migration AND task-graph review gate confirmation, write
`schema_version: 2` via the atomic write protocol.

## Interrupt Recovery

On invocation, if a task has `status = in_progress` AND `verified_at_commit = null`:

**No task-owned dirty files beyond `baseline_dirty_files`:** Prompt:
> "Task X was marked `in_progress` but no commit was recorded. Was the prior
> session interrupted? Reset to `failing` and retry, or investigate first?"

**Task-owned dirty files present:** MUST NOT reset/restore/clean/discard. Print:
- `start_commit`
- `baseline_dirty_files`
- `git status --short`
- Task-owned files changed since `start_commit`
- Last failing gate + reproduction commands

Offer only: continue investigation, mark blocked with text, or drop to manual.
