## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-20

Initial scaffolding release. Establishes the workspace layout and crate
boundaries; functional implementations land in subsequent releases.

### Added

- Cargo workspace with five crates under lockstep versioning:
  - `opi-ai` — unified multi-provider LLM API (module scaffolding for
    `provider`, `stream`, `model`, `config`).
  - `opi-tui` — terminal UI library (module scaffolding for `render`,
    `editor`, `markdown`).
  - `opi-agent` — agent runtime with tool calling and transport
    abstraction (module scaffolding for `tool`, `transport`, `state`).
  - `opi-web-ui` — reusable web chat components (module scaffolding for
    `components`).
  - `opi-coding-agent` — produces the `opi` binary; supports `--version`
    and `--help`.
- `opi-release` skill (`.claude/skills/opi-release/skill.md`) implementing
  a seven-phase release workflow with explicit irreversibility gates.

### Notes

- All crate APIs are placeholders. Calling them will not do anything
  useful yet.
- This release is published as a GitHub Release only; crates.io publish
  is deferred until the crates have real implementations.
