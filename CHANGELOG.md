All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- `opi-ai`: provider collection and authentication seam — a dedicated collection/auth runtime that lets model/auth ownership move out of ad hoc provider construction.
- `opi-agent`: generic `AgentHarness` seam separating generic phase/snapshot/session orchestration from the product-specific coding harness.
- `opi-agent`: session repository/facade seam (`SessionFacade`, `SessionRepo`) giving richer session context a first-class entry point instead of CLI-only writes.

### Changed

- `opi-coding-agent`: provider construction centralized into `provider_factory`; when a configured HTTP proxy fails to build, provider construction and `--list-models` now surface `failed to build HTTP client with proxy config: <cause>` instead of the bare cause string (message-wording change only).
- `opi-coding-agent`: `CodingHarness` documented as a product wrapper over the generic `opi-agent` seams, with runtime hook boundaries documented (Phase 10 WS10.4).
- Added Phase 10 documentation guards and an exit-trace completeness gate, and refreshed the root and crate READMEs, `opi-spec`, and the pi alignment matrix for the post-Phase-10 current state.
- Bumped the workspace version to `0.6.2` and refreshed the Phase 4 specification-hash ledger to match the current `docs/opi-spec.md`.
- This release publishes the publishable crates to both GitHub Releases and crates.io in dependency order; it is the first crates.io release since `0.5.4` (`0.6.0` and `0.6.1` were GitHub-only documentation/guard-test releases).

### Fixed

- Addressed Phase 10 audit findings across the centralized provider factory and surrounding documentation.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- `opi-coding-agent`: Phase 9 pi 0.80.2 baseline documentation guard tests pin the durable alignment-matrix evidence baseline, the normative specification, and the pi alignment matrix against `.repo/pi-0.80.2` as the current studied upstream, keep the Phase 9-14 roadmap consistent across English and Chinese counterparts, and reject current-scope overclaims for deferred ecosystem breadth (OAuth parity, image generation, custom extension UI parity, npm/gallery, web/share, and pi session compatibility).

### Changed

- Recorded the Phase 9.1 alignment-matrix, Phase 9.2 normative-specification, and Phase 9.3 supplemental-design baseline evidence, and archived the opi-implement Phase 9 ledger snapshot.
- Bumped the workspace version to `0.6.1` and refreshed the Phase 4 specification-hash ledger to match the current `docs/opi-spec.md`.
- This release is published to GitHub only; crates.io publishing is intentionally skipped because it contains documentation and guard-test changes only.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

- Realigned the implementation roadmap against the `pi` 0.80.2 evidence baseline, adding Phase 9 baseline realignment, Phase 10 architecture deepening, and refreshed Phase 11-14 planning documents.
- Updated the English and Chinese technical specification and pi alignment matrix to reflect the current roadmap and phase boundaries.
- This release is published to GitHub only; crates.io publishing is intentionally skipped because it contains planning and documentation changes only.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- `opi-agent`: README (English and Chinese) classifies the public runtime, extension, event, session, SDK/RPC, and streaming-proxy surfaces as supported 0.x or unstable internal, with their stability mechanism (`#[non_exhaustive]`, module `# Unstable` prose, and the `SDK`/`NDJSON`/`TRACE` schema versions) and an explicit Phase 8 non-goal list; the pi alignment matrix records a Phase 8 runtime-stabilization row. Guard tests pin the classification against the crate-root re-exports and reject the Phase 8 non-goals.

### Changed

- `opi-coding-agent`: RPC JSONL synchronous rejection responses for runtime-contract failures now carry a stable machine-readable `error_code` — `agent_busy`, `harness_unavailable`, `compaction_failed`, `extension_command_not_handled` (alongside the existing `unsupported_trace_request`) — on the additive `SdkResponse::error_code` field. The SDK schema version is unchanged at `3`; idle `set_model` / `set_thinking_level` capability errors remain free-text.

### Fixed

- `opi-coding-agent`: resumed session-recovery diagnostics now reach the in-process diagnostic recording sink (and are counted by run summaries) instead of only `session_info` resource metadata, matching how compaction is already wired.
- `opi-agent`: parallel tool-result handling now satisfies newer Clippy releases by removing a redundant iterator conversion.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- `opi-agent`: shared diagnostic vocabulary (`Diagnostic`, `DiagnosticPayload`, `Severity`, `RedactionMode`, `redact`/`redact_text`, `DiagnosticSink`, `RecordingSink`, `NullSink`) with deterministic, ordered serialization and Summary/Verbose redaction reusing `SecretRedactor`.
- `opi-agent`: provider, retry, cancellation, tool, compaction, session-recovery, package/adapter, config, and RPC paths now record structured diagnostics instead of bare strings.
- `opi-ai` / `opi-agent`: `ProviderErrorCategory` taxonomy (`Auth`, `RateLimit`, `Timeout`, `Request`, `Stream`) with `ProviderError::category()` and `retry_after_ms()` accessors, mapped into the shared diagnostic code/severity/source triple for consistent redacted reporting across stderr, JSON, and trace surfaces.
- `opi-agent`: redaction core extended with GitHub PAT, credentialed-URL userinfo, and `Authorization` header patterns shared by all diagnostic surfaces, plus Phase 7 redaction/shared-shape/non-goal guard tests.
- `opi-agent`: unstable local trace envelope substrate — `TRACE_SCHEMA_VERSION`, non_exhaustive `TraceKind`, Serialize-only `TraceRecord`, `TraceSink` trait with fail-closed `prepare` and fail-open `write`, `TraceCollector` with redaction, and a crash-resilient `FileTraceSink` exposed for embedders.
- `opi-agent` / `opi-coding-agent`: trace envelope wired into the agent loop; run/turn/provider/tool records are emitted via `observe()`; opt-in `--trace <path>` writes a redacted envelope for non-interactive and JSON modes (interactive/RPC excluded).
- `opi-agent`: RPC JSONL gains a `trace` command returning the versioned, redacted envelope; the RPC runner records a `RecordingTraceSink` by default; `SdkResponse` carries a new additive `error_code` field for machine-readable `unsupported_trace_request` errors.
- `opi-agent`: NDJSON mode gains a `StartupDiagnostics` event emitted before `AgentStart` and an additive `diagnostics: SessionDiagnosticCounts { info, warning, error }` tally on `SessionSummary`, both omitted when absent.
- `opi-coding-agent`: top-level `opi doctor` local health check, distinct from `opi package doctor`; network-free, reports shared `Diagnostic` values for `config`, `provider`, `package`, `session`, `tui`, and `rpc` scopes with `--json` NDJSON output and `--scope` filtering, redacting absolute paths at the boundary; exits `0` clean, `2` on any error-severity diagnostic, `1` on internal or argument failure.

### Changed

- `opi-agent` / `opi-coding-agent`: SDK/RPC schema version is now `3` and NDJSON schema version is now `2` to carry the new trace and diagnostic fields; both remain unstable 0.x contracts and existing consumers keep parsing via additive, `#[serde(default)]` fields.

### Fixed

- `opi-coding-agent`: non-interactive JSON mode provider-error stderr now routes through the shared diagnostic redactor instead of emitting raw error strings, keeping a static `provider error` class string.

### Removed

- `opi-web-ui`: removed the unpublished web-facing crate from the workspace; future web UI work should be planned as a separate RPC/SDK consumer surface.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- `opi-coding-agent`: RPC JSONL mode now surfaces provider and harness construction diagnostics at startup and documents the session JSONL format as an unstable 0.x contract instead of implying stability.
- `opi-coding-agent`: `opi package` runtime degraded paths (adapter, lock, source, and resource failures) now report actionable diagnostics instead of failing silently.
- `opi-coding-agent`: the process-JSONL adapter protocol (`opi-extension-jsonl-v1`) is documented honestly as an unstable 0.x protocol, and adapter startup diagnostics are enriched.
- `opi-coding-agent`: Phase 6 documentation-truth and reliability audit gaps are closed; current-state docs, the spec hash ledger, and the English/Chinese counterparts now stay synchronized with the workspace version, guarded by Phase 6 alignment tests.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- `opi-coding-agent`: `--fork <session-id>` plus interactive `/tree`, `/fork`, and `/clone` session commands that copy the active branch into a new parented session without rewriting the source JSONL file.
- `opi-agent` / `opi-coding-agent`: RPC/SDK `extension_command` support for dispatching correlated custom commands to registered extension registries.
- `opi-coding-agent`: config-driven OpenAI-compatible provider profiles with model metadata, compatibility flags, runtime provider construction, and registry-backed `--list-models` output.
- `opi-web-ui`: `ConversationState` now tracks resource metadata from `session_info` responses and the last successful compaction response payload.
- `opi-coding-agent`: runtime session persistence now writes meaningful `parent_id` links and `leaf` pointers so continuing from a selected branch tip creates a same-file branch path.
- `opi-coding-agent`: `opi package add/remove/list/doctor` now validates package manifests, writes lock entries, and reports installed package diagnostics.
- `opi-coding-agent`: manifest V2 supports `[adapter]` process adapters with the `opi-extension-jsonl-v1` JSONL protocol.
- `opi-coding-agent`: installed package declarations are loaded during runtime startup so adapter tools, commands, hooks, events, state, and cancellation bridge into the extension API.
- `opi-coding-agent`: example adapter packages demonstrate todo state, permission-gate example hooks, and protected path hooks through a runnable process adapter.

### Changed

- `opi-agent`: moved the core loop implementation out of `lib.rs` into an internal `agent_loop` module while preserving the public `opi_agent::agent_loop` export.

### Fixed

- `opi-tui`: `SelectList` and `BranchPicker` now account for selected-row markers and CJK display width when aligning labels with metadata.
- `opi-coding-agent`: `opi package doctor` now rejects invalid manifest V2 adapter declarations and reports lock/source/resource/adapter diagnostics.
- `opi-coding-agent`: Adapter state snapshots are persisted in session JSONL and restored on resume.
- `opi-coding-agent`: Adapter event drops are diagnostic-visible, shutdown allows a bounded graceful exit, local package identity is canonicalized, SSH git source parsing is URL-aware, and relative adapter commands cannot escape package roots.
- `opi-coding-agent`: Linux build and test correctness — removed a dead Unix-only import that failed `clippy`/`test`/`doc` under `-D warnings`, and test-binary locators no longer match cargo `.d` dep-info siblings (which lack the execute bit and caused `EACCES` when spawning adapters).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-07

Phase 4: extension system, RPC JSONL protocol, SDK embedding surface,
progressive resource discovery, session branching, streaming proxy,
custom provider registration, and six extension examples.

- `opi-coding-agent`: example package manifests use the supported flat `package.toml` schema.
- `opi-agent`: `StreamingProxy::run` is synchronous transport-agnostic I/O instead of an async wrapper around blocking reads.

### Fixed

- `opi-coding-agent`: Windows subprocess tests resolve `opi.exe` correctly.
- `opi-web-ui`: RPC response `data` is preserved and updates session/model state.
- `opi-coding-agent`: same-layer duplicate resource/package names now produce explicit errors.
- `opi-coding-agent`: package resource containment checks no longer fall back to unresolved paths when canonicalization fails.
- `opi-agent`: default secret redaction no longer redacts short benign `sk-` or `eyJ`-like strings.
- `opi-agent`: `SdkResponse` now round-trips through JSON and serialization fallback events use `SdkSerializationError`.
- `opi-web-ui`: `ThinkingBlock` is re-exported from the crate root with the other component models.
- `opi-coding-agent`: phase 4 ledger hash check normalized for cross-platform consistency.

### Removed

- `opi-agent`: stale public `Transport` stub.

  directory.

### Changed

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-20

Initial scaffolding release. Establishes the workspace layout and crate
boundaries; functional implementations land in subsequent releases.

### Added

- Cargo workspace with five crates under lockstep versioning:
  - `opi-ai` — unified multi-provider LLM API (module scaffolding for
    `provider`, `stream`, `model`, `config`).
  - `opi-tui` — terminal UI library (module scaffolding for `render`,
    `editor`, `markdown`).
  - `opi-agent` — agent runtime with tool calling and transport
    abstraction (module scaffolding for `tool`, `transport`, `state`).
  - `opi-web-ui` — reusable web chat components (module scaffolding for
    `components`).
  - `opi-coding-agent` — produces the `opi` binary; supports `--version`
    and `--help`.
- `opi-release` skill (`.claude/skills/opi-release/skill.md`) implementing
  a seven-phase release workflow with explicit irreversibility gates.

### Notes

- All crate APIs are placeholders. Calling them will not do anything
  useful yet.
- This release is published as a GitHub Release only; crates.io publish
  is deferred until the crates have real implementations.
