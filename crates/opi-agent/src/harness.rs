//! Generic agent harness seam (Phase 10, Workstream 10.2).
//!
//! [`AgentHarness`] is the generic, product-agnostic orchestration layer above
//! [`crate::Agent`]. It owns the conversation lifecycle concerns that are NOT
//! specific to the coding-agent product:
//!
//! - explicit lifecycle [`Phase`]s (`Idle`, `Turn`, `Compaction`, `BranchSummary`);
//! - structural operations rejected while busy;
//! - queue operations accepted only at documented safe points (idle);
//! - runtime-config mutation that affects *future* turn snapshots, never an
//!   in-flight turn;
//! - a pending-write queue whose flush orders agent-emitted messages *before*
//!   pending extension/session writes;
//! - save points at operation settlement;
//! - `abort` that leaves no active operation and never silently discards an
//!   already-accepted pending write.
//!
//! `Agent` remains the low-level loop + provider + hooks runtime. `AgentHarness`
//! wraps an `Agent` by value and delegates control/cancel/message accessors to
//! it unchanged. The phase transitions are state-machine guards plus
//! snapshot/save-point discipline; `AgentHarness` exposes no prompt/continue/step
//! method and never drives the loop itself.
//!
//! This is a published, contract-tested, unstable-0.x library surface and the
//! generic seam the coding-agent product wrapper (`opi_coding_agent::CodingHarness`)
//! composes over. The product wrapper owns coding-agent policy (built-in file
//! tools, CLI config, context files, package resources, interactive commands,
//! product defaults); this module owns the generic turn lifecycle, phase guards,
//! save points, runtime-config snapshots, and pending-write ordering. Routing
//! the product turn loop *through* `AgentHarness` is a later incremental
//! migration, not a thin adapter: `AgentHarness::new` takes the `Agent` by
//! value, so product adoption needs either a harness API extension or the
//! session-facade migration tracked in Workstream 10.3 (task 10.5). The Phase 10
//! design's implementation notes explicitly prefer letting existing product
//! behavior continue while generic seams are introduced, so this surface ships
//! ahead of that migration.
//!
//! Branch summaries are a guarded lifecycle phase here, but their durable entry
//! representation is intentionally deferred to the session-facade work (task
//! 10.5), which owns the "branch summaries as context messages, metadata, or
//! both" decision recorded in Workstream 10.3.

/// the session contract: a library caller that needs ordered durable session
/// writes and active-branch reads without driving an [`Agent`] loop composes
/// this directly. [`AgentHarness`] keeps the phase-guarded turn lifecycle (it
/// wraps an `Agent` by value); `SessionFacade` is the stable session seam
/// Phase 13 extends with richer entry types and context reconstruction.
///
/// # Phase 10 decisions (Workstream 10.3)
///
/// These four deferred decisions are resolved here and left documented for
/// Phase 13:
///
/// - **D1 (additive-v1):** the v1 JSONL accepts additive `SessionEntry`
///   variants. `SessionEntry` is `#[non_exhaustive]` and [`SessionReader`]
///   reports (does not fatal on) lines whose `type` tag it does not recognize,
///   so a v1 file written by a newer opi remains readable. Phase 13 may
///   introduce `version = 2`; v1 files stay readable and resumable without a
///   migration command (spec S9.3). No new entry variants are added in
///   Phase 10 -- the seam is the non-exhaustive enum plus the forward-compatible
///   reader.
/// - **D2 (branch summaries):** a durable branch-summary representation is
///   metadata, not an injected provider-context message. Its representation
///   and any context injection are Phase 13 (spec S9.3 lists `branch_summary`
///   as a Phase 13 v2 target); [`AgentHarness::begin_branch_summary`] keeps
///   the lifecycle guard introduced in task 10.3.
/// - **D3 (extension custom messages):** the durable seam persists extension
///   state (including extension-provided messages); whether and how such
///   messages enter provider context is governed by the existing
///   `include_in_llm_context` flag on extension messages and is deferred to
///   Phase 13 context reconstruction. Phase 10 adds no provider-context
///   injection.
/// - **D4 (unfinished-operation recovery):** recovery marks an interrupted
///   operation and returns to idle; it never replays an in-flight provider
///   stream and never retries unsafe tools (e.g. `bash`/`write`) on resume.
///   Provider streams are not resumable. Richer recovery is Phase 13.
